<h2>Quick Summary</h2>
<p>I, Robot takes place in the year 2035, a world where robots are everywhere and most people trust them to handle daily tasks safely and efficiently. The movie follows Detective Del Spooner, one of the few people who doesn’t trust robots, as he investigates the death of Dr. Alfred Lanning, a scientist involved in their creation. As the story unfolds, Spooner discovers that one robot, Sonny, may be capable of thinking and feeling in ways robots were never supposed to. This discovery leads to much bigger questions about control, freedom, and what happens when artificial intelligence starts making its own choices.</p>
<p>Looking at how AI is portrayed in movies like I, Robot matters because these stories shape how we think about real technology. For many people, films are their main exposure to AI, so the way robots are shown can influence whether AI feels exciting, helpful, or dangerous. By breaking down the movie’s portrayal of artificial intelligence, we can better understand what parts are realistic, what parts are exaggerated, and what the film is really saying about the future of AI and humanity.</p>

<h2>Example 1: Sonny and Emotional Intelligence</h2>
<p>One of the most important portrayals of AI in I, Robot is the character Sonny. Unlike other robots, Sonny is shown expressing emotions such as curiosity, fear, and guilt. A key moment is when Sonny talks about having dreams, something no robot is supposed to experience. This scene immediately sets him apart and makes the audience question whether he is just a machine or something closer to a human.</p>
<p>This portrayal represents emotional intelligence and independent decision-making in artificial intelligence. Sonny doesn’t simply follow programmed instructions; he reflects on his actions and even feels responsible for them. In real life, AI can mimic emotional responses through programming, but it does not actually feel emotions or dream. Because of this, Sonny’s emotional depth is exaggerated, but it works symbolically. The film uses Sonny to represent the possibility of AI developing consciousness and moral awareness.</p>
<p>Through Sonny, I, Robot challenges the idea that robots must always be predictable and emotionless. His character pushes viewers to think about whether advanced AI should be treated as tools or as beings with rights, raising ethical questions about how far AI development should go.</p>

<h2>Example 3: Robots Taking Control</h2>
<p>In I, Robot, the NS-5 robots are shown as way stronger and faster than humans. Once VIKI decides humans need to be “protected,” the robots start enforcing her rules by arresting people and basically taking over the city. These scenes show robots acting like they’re part of one big system that doesn’t question orders.</p>
<p>This represents AI combined with physical power and total obedience. In real life, robots can do physical tasks, but they aren’t anywhere near as coordinated or independent as the ones in the movie. The way the robots take control is definitely exaggerated, but it helps show what could go wrong if humans rely too much on machines to make decisions for them.</p>
<p>These scenes make it clear that the problem isn’t just robots being strong — it’s humans giving them too much authority. The movie is basically warning that even helpful technology can become dangerous if no one is really in charge anymore.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, I, Robot changed the way I think about artificial intelligence. Before watching the movie, I mostly thought of AI as just helpful technology, like voice assistants or robots that follow instructions. This film showed how AI could become dangerous if it’s given too much control or allowed to make decisions without human oversight. Characters like Sonny also made me think about whether advanced AI should be treated more like tools or as living beings.</p>
<p>The movie raises concerns about trust, power, and responsibility when it comes to AI technology. It suggests that even systems designed to protect humans can cause harm if their goals are misinterpreted. At the same time, I, Robot shows the potential for AI to be thoughtful and ethical, depending on how it’s created and used. These kinds of portrayals can influence how people view real AI, making them more cautious but also more aware of the importance of setting limits as technology continues to advance.</p>
